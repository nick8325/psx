p33: address space

In user mode, any address above 2Gbytes (most-significant bit of the address set) is illegal and causes a trap. Also, some instructions cause a trap in user mode

memory map:
0-0x8: user mode, phys address = virt address + 1GB (presumably PSX mirrors x^1GB and x)
  - according to NO$PSX, every 512MB is mirrored (0, 0x2, 0x4, ...)
  - maybe scratchpad isn't?
0x8-0xa: kernel mode, cached, phys address = virt address - 0x8
0xa-0xc: kernel mode, uncached, phys address = virt address - 0xa
0xc-: kernel mode, cached, identity mapped

p45: cop0 registers

- main memory is mapped every 2MB from 0 to 16MB
- then at 0x20000000 (mirrored at +2MB) - nocash says isn't on a
  real machine

clock rate:
lcm clock rate: 44100*0x300*11 Hz (~372MHz)
cpu runs one cycle per 11 clocks (~33.8MHz)
gpu runs one cycle per 7 clocks (~53.2MHz)
system clock (used for timers etc.): cpu clock/8 (~4.23MHz)

system clock: 4mhz?

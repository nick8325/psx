p33: address space

In user mode, any address above 2Gbytes (most-significant bit of the address set) is illegal and causes a trap. Also, some instructions cause a trap in user mode

memory map:
0-0x8: user mode, phys address = virt address + 1GB (presumably PSX mirrors x^1GB and x)
  - according to NO$PSX, every 512MB is mirrored (0, 0x2, 0x4, ...)
  - maybe scratchpad isn't?
0x8-0xa: kernel mode, cached, phys address = virt address - 0x8
0xa-0xc: kernel mode, uncached, phys address = virt address - 0xa
0xc-: kernel mode, cached, identity mapped

Implement controller/memory card bus, see if it fixes interlacing bug (timing)
Clean up I/O processing so that you can register callbacks
Allow devices to pause (coroutine library)
Add device timings
GPU: skip polygons that are too big
Think about how to save/load state when we use closure iterators (and also the state of the event queue)
[maybe have explicit state too - e.g. GPU has a FIFO - so that we can
always resume the system just from the state]
GPU: current approach to drawing polylines draws corner points
multiple times. Instead, skip the final point of each line when
drawing. Then in the GPU, if the polyline doesn't form a closed
curve., add a final point to it.

Implement controller/memory card bus, see if it fixes interlacing bug (timing)
Clean up memory delay code - have memory reads advance events.now()
- However, event callbacks should always see the "correct" time, even
  if we fast-forwarded past it
- Does this make sense? Maybe this means we shouldn't advance the
  global time, but only the processor's view of time
Allow different I/O devices to have different memory delays
Clean up I/O processing so that you can register callbacks
Allow devices to add their own local delays

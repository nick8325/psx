gtkwave for viewing waveforms

"Nocash was very likely fucking up something while measuring" - on
"RGB Intensity Notes", section has been removed now

Accuracy:

* Check: does PC get set correctly after J+RFE when an irq is waiting?
  I.e., the rfe will immediately enable interrupts. Will the new PC
  from the J instruction be loaded before the interrupt is handled?
* Allow devices to pause (coroutine library)
* Add device timings including GTE
* Reimplement CDROM with proper timing
* Pixels are not necessarily square - draw them properly

Bugs:

* (current?) Find out why only some BIOSes are able to boot a CD
* (current?) Find out why only some BIOSes are able to boot an EXE
* Crash Bandicoot: why is it running at half speed? (Come back to this after audio is done)
* GPU: why are games flickering? Effect doesn't appear when viewing raw VRAM,
  so may be something to do with double buffering
* Fix weird sound

Features:

* Implement on-disk save states
* Add a debugger
* Use Nim effect system to check use of 'effect:' in GPU coroutine thingy

Allow devices to pause (coroutine library)
Add device timings
GPU: skip polygons that are too big
Have explicit state - e.g. GPU has a FIFO - so that we can
always resume the system just from the state
GPU: current approach to drawing polylines draws corner points
multiple times. Instead, skip the final point of each line when
drawing. Then in the GPU, if the polyline doesn't form a closed
curve., add a final point to it.
Fix edge cases with GTE (ps1-tests tests)
Reimplement CDROM with proper timing
Find out why only some BIOSes are able to boot a CD
Find out why only some BIOSes are able to boot an EXE
Implement on-disk save states
Add a debugger
Fix graphical glitch in memory card browser
Find out why the system is running at half speed (investigate timers etc)

Accuracy:

* Allow devices to pause (coroutine library)
* Add device timings including GTE
* GPU: current approach to drawing polylines draws corner points multiple times. Instead, skip the final point of each line when drawing. Then in the GPU, if the polyline doesn't form a closed curve., add a final point to it.
* Reimplement CDROM with proper timing
* Pixels are not necessarily square - draw them properly

Bugs:

* (current?) Find out why only some BIOSes are able to boot a CD
* (current?) Find out why only some BIOSes are able to boot an EXE
* Fix graphical glitch in memory card browser
* Crash Bandicoot: why is it running at half speed? (Come back to this after audio is done)
* Ridge Racer: why is the ground not drawn properly?

Features:

* Implement on-disk save states
* Add a debugger

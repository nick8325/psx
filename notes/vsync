vblank true when not on visible scanline
  - upper and lower limits? none except <= total scanlines
hblank?
  - current_tick_in_scanline >= 200?
  - seems hblank timings are a bit funny on ps2 too (on for half of the scanline)
    so maybe is asserted at interesting times
  - could also be that it's edge-triggered or whatnot
bit31: fix in non-interlaced mode
 - m_GPUSTAT.interlaced_field: alternates in interlaced mode, 0 in non-interlaced (GPUSTAT 13h)
 - also interlaced_display_field
 - m_GPUSTAT.display_line_lsb: interlaced - same as interlaced_field except 0 in vblank, non-interlaced: current scanline (including invisible)
 
 non-interlaced:
vsync start: 0x5602260a - even bit 31
vsync end:   0xd602260a - odd bit 31
maybe other way round? is bit 31 one on start vsync?

(same even/odd frames)

interlaced:
vsync start: 0xd64a020a - odd bit 31
vsync end:   0xd64a020a
vsync start: 0x564a220a - even bit 31
vsync end:   0x564a220a

or: 
vsync start: 0xd64a000f
vsync end:   0xd64a000f
vsync start: 0x564a000f
vsync end:   0x564a200f

non-interlaced plus interlace (bit 22), double resolution (bit 19)
interlace field is changing (bit 13) and is opposite to bit 31
